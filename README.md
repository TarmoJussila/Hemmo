# HEMMO

**Team Raunio** is excited to introduce to you our game entry for Global Game Jam / Finnish Game Jam 2021. **Introspection** is a classic platformer puzzle game with a nostalgic atmosphere.

# History

The Hemmo game project was initially launched in 2009 with ambitious plans, but was never taken from a concept to a prototype. We wanted to change that and breath life into this dear old project of ours. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it.
