# HEMMO

**Hemmo** is a classic platformer game with a nostalgic atmosphere. In this game you are playing as Hemmo the French bulldog. Hemmo has found himself at a difficult situation where all his masks have been lost. Can you help Hemmo find all the lost masks and make Hemmo feel *funky* again?

>NOTICE: You can find the Global Game Jam 2021 version of the game from [the release page](https://github.com/TarmoJussila/Hemmo/releases/tag/global-game-jam-2021).

# History

The Hemmo game project was initially launched in 2009 with ambitious plans, but was eventually never advanced from a concept to a prototype. In 2021, at the dawn of the new decade, we wanted to change that and breath life into this dear old project of ours during the Global Game Jam 2021. We hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed creating it.
